# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub

Hi, I'm Ajith Chandran. I'm a Cyber Seurity Analyst. I'm passionate about Cyber Security and I'm always looking for new ways to learn and grow. I'm excited to use GitHub to share my work and collaborate with others on open source projects.

Here are some of the things I'm working on:
       * Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Integration: 
       * Vulnerability Scanning and Management
       * Malware Analysis Framework
       
I'm also interested in Penetration Testing. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me.

Thanks for visiting my profile!
